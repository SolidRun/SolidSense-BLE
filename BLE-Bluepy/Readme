The BLE-Test2.py is giving an example on how to use it to run it: sudo python3 BLE-Test2.py

Know restrictions:
  Currently fully tested only for advertisement, even if some features are missing
  
  GATT client is implemented and will work with synchronous transactions (read/write), but Notification handling is not working well.
